# dataincubator-stock-project

In the spirit of getting to know flask I set up an app factory in /app that is called with stocks.py,
which is a little different than how this repo is set up: https://github.com/thedataincubator/flask-framework.
Most of the work is done between the routes.py and /templates.stock.html in the factory directory. The final
product can be viewed at https://david-hampton-dti-12day-cap.herokuapp.com/. Thinking about making it a little
fancier.
